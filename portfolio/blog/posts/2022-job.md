## Introduction
When it comes to choosing your first job, it's a decision that can shape your entire career trajectory.

 For me, the decision was particularly challenging as I had a deep passion for technology but was presented with a unique job opportunity in the finance sector. 
 
 In this blog post, I'll delve into the reasons behind my choice to join the world of finance over the tech industry and how this decision has shaped my career.


## The Job Offer: Market Analyst at Futures First

My journey began with a job offer from Futures First, a renowned financial firm. The role of a Market Analyst offered intriguing responsibilities, including:

#### Portfolio Management
As a Market Analyst, my primary duty was to manage portfolios. This involved making strategic decisions on various financial assets, optimizing risk and return, and constantly monitoring market trends.
 

#### Financial Analysis and Development of Quantitative Strategies
Analyzing financial data and developing quantitative strategies were key components of my role. 

## Contemplating the Decision
Choosing between this finance opportunity and pursuing a career in tech was not a straightforward decision. I faced a few dilemmas:

#### Passion vs. Monetary Rewards
Tech had always been my passion. The ever-evolving nature of the tech industry and the potential for innovation were immensely appealing. However, the allure of substantial monetary rewards in finance was challenging to ignore. It's no secret that the finance sector often offers competitive salaries and bonuses.

#### Geographic and Time Challenges
Accepting this finance role meant relocating to a different city and adapting to work hours dictated by European and American exchanges. This presented a unique lifestyle challenge, as my daily routine would need to align with global market hours.

#### High Attrition Rates
One aspect that gave me pause was the high attrition rate within the company. The fast-paced, high-stress environment of finance can lead to turnover, which raised questions about long-term job stability.

## Career Advantages of the Finance-Tech Combination
Despite the hurdles and my passion for technology, I ultimately decided to seize this unique job opportunity in finance. Here's why:

Embracing Diverse Career Experiences
I recognized that trying out different industries early in my career could provide me with invaluable experiences and insights. This diversification could be beneficial for my long-term career growth, even if I eventually transitioned into tech.

### Software and Finance: A Lethal Combination
I realized that the intersection of software and finance was a powerful one. These two domains underpin numerous aspects of the modern world, from algorithmic trading to financial technology (FinTech). By gaining expertise in both fields, I would be well-equipped for a wide range of future opportunities.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, my decision to choose a career in finance over tech was a unique one, driven by a combination of financial incentives, career diversification, and the recognition of the synergy between finance and technology. While I still hold my passion for technology close to my heart, this unexpected path has opened doors and provided me with a well-rounded skill set that I believe will serve me well in whatever direction my career takes next.
